        "Address the 'biggest concern' (lack of initial direction) by adopting the 'Learn by Doing' method: never spend more than 30 minutes watching a tutorial without immediately pausing to type out and modify the code yourself.",
        "Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes focused work, 5-minute break) within your 5-hour blocks. This prevents burnout and maximizes retention when your initial purpose isn't fully defined.",
        "Find a low-stakes accountability partner, perhaps someone else learning a new skill, or just schedule a recurring 10-minute check-in with yourself every Friday to review what you accomplished that week.",
        "Keep a 'Stupid Questions' document. Every time you get stuck or confused, write down the question. Reviewing this list monthly shows you how far you've progressed, which is a huge motivator."
